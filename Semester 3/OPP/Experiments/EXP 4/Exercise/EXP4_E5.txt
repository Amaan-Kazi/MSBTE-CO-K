struct and class are mostly similar in functionality
the main difference is that by default, when no access specifier is defined:
struct: Members and Methods are public
class: Members and Methods are private

Both structs and classes can have
Data members (variables)
Member functions (methods)
Constructors and destructors
Inheritance
Polymorphism
